# ChatroomProgram
this is a moderately simple Chatroom application with a server side code and a client side coode. The messeges which are being hosted, are encoded in ascii and then decoded when passing through the server, before reaching the connected clients

I've attached a screenshot below, which shows the programming running in my terminal. The terminal on the left side is the server side code and the top right and bottom right terminal is running the client side code.
